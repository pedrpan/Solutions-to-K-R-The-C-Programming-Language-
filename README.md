# Solutions-to-K-R-The-C-Programming-Language-
Solutions to K&amp;R "The C Programming Language"

Most of the solutions to the exercises in K&R's "The C Programming Language." All of the solutions are my original effort and therefore some of the solutions may be inefficient, but they will always be original. I have put considerable effort into testing and debugging all of the solutions on onlinedegb.com and therefore I am fairly certain that all of the solutons are correct. You can also see my progression as a C programmer, as my solutions get more and more elegant and creative as the chapter numbers go up. 

I hope you enjoy.
